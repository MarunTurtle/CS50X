# Credit - CS50x 2024

## Overview
This problem set involves creating a program in C to validate credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm and identify the card type (American Express, MasterCard, or Visa).

## Objectives
- Implement Luhn's Algorithm to check the validity of a credit card number.
- Identify the card type based on number patterns.

## Instructions
1. **Prompt User**: Request the credit card number.
2. **Apply Luhn's Algorithm**: Validate the card number.
3. **Identify Card Type**: Determine if it's AMEX, MasterCard, Visa, or INVALID.
4. **Output Result**: Display the card type.

## Steps
1. Write pseudocode.
2. Implement the algorithm in `credit.c`.
3. Test the program with various inputs.

## Example
```sh
$ ./credit
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
