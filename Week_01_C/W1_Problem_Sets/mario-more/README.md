# Mario (More Comfortable) - CS50x 2024

## Overview
In this problem set, you will create a program in C to recreate adjacent pyramids of blocks, inspired by Super Mario Bros. The bricks will be represented using hashes (`#`).

## Objectives
- Prompt the user for the pyramid's height.
- Print adjacent pyramids of the specified height.
- Ensure valid input using a `do while` loop.

## Instructions

1. **Prompt User**: Request the pyramid's height (1 to 8).
2. **Validate Input**: Re-prompt if the input is not within the specified range.
3. **Print Pyramids**: Display two adjacent pyramids with a gap of two spaces.

## Example Output
```sh
$ ./mario
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```
