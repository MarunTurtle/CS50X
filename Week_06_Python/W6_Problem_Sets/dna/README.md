# DNA - CS50x 2024

[CS50 DNA Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/6/dna/)

## Overview

Create a program in Python to identify individuals based on their DNA sequences by matching Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) in a DNA sample against a database.

## Objectives

- Read and parse a CSV database of STR counts.
- Read a DNA sequence file.
- Implement STR matching to identify individuals.

## Instructions

1. **Load Data**: Read the CSV database.
2. **Sequence Analysis**: Read and analyze the DNA sequence.
3. **Match STRs**: Compare STR counts against the database to find a match.
