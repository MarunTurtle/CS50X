  - [Sentimental Mario Less](Week_06_Python/W6_Problem_Sets/sentimental-mario_less)
    - Create a Python program that prompts the user for a height between 1 and 8 and prints a right-aligned pyramid of that height using hash symbols (`#`).
  - [Sentimental Mario More](Week_06_Python/W6_Problem_Sets/sentimental-mario_more)
    - Create a Python program that prompts the user for a height (between 1 and 8 inclusive) and prints two adjacent pyramids of that height separated by two spaces.
  - [Sentimental Readability](Week_06_Python/W6_Problem_Sets/sentimental-readability)
    - Create a Python program that prompts the user for text input, calculates the number of letters, words, and sentences, computes the Coleman-Liau index, and prints the corresponding grade level.
